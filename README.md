# POC WebSocket x Python

This repository is a Proof of Concept for executing Python scripts on a Node.js server and sending back the result of the script execution to the client through WebSockets. It's intended to allow the use of Python ML models for "real-time" web usages in the most performant way possible. The server implementation is available under the [server](./server) folder and the client implementation under the [client](./client) folder.
